# 3D-Spatially-Biased-NN
A modification to PyTorch that allows for higher dimensional modelling and spatially biased connections between these higher dimension layers. 

# Overall Plan
1. Create a basic template to modify and use
2. Choose a good basic dataset with which to use as a benchmark
3. Train the basic template (BT) on the data, then test and get benchmarks 
4. Create 3D modification, test, get benchmark 
5. Create spatially biased (SB) modification, get benchmark 
6. Combine 3D and SB, get benchmark
7. Compare original and 3D+SB metrics
